# Project Details for M.Tech. CDS and AI Students

1. Title: FrameEdit: In-Context Temporal Frame Generation via LLM–Diffusion Fusion
Details: Extending the capabilities of GenHowTo (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07322) and ShowHowTo (https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01987), we aim to generate the n’th frame from given initial frames while ensuring temporal and structural consistency aligned with given new action prompts. We frame this as an in-context editing problem, leveraging fused Autoregressive LLMs and Generative Diffusion Transformers inspired by Jenus-Pro (https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17811), OmniGen (https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11340), and OmniGen-v2 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18871), with significant potential for applications such as robotics, AR, VR etc.
